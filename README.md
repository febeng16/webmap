# Airport Web Map In The US

This is an introduction to an interactive web map of airports in the United States. When designing this web map, I made sure that I provided proper symbolization for my data to make it legible, understandable, and appealing to anyone who sees it. I added an interactive component that allows the user to select any airport marker on the map and it will display the name of the Airport. 

To create this map, data was retrieved from:

- us-states.geojson is a geojson data file containing all the states' boundaries of the United States. This data is acquired from [Mike Bostock](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/) of D3. 
- airports.geojson contains all the airports in the United States. This data is converted from a shapefile, which was downloaded and unzipped from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/usgs-small-scale-dataset-airports-of-the-united-states-201207-shapefile.
