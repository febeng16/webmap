# Airport Web Map In The US

This is an introduction to an interactive web map of airports in the United States. When designing this web map, i made sure that i provided proper symbolization for my data to make it legible, understandable, and appealing to anyone who sees it. I added an interactive component that allows the user to select any airport marker on the map and it will display the name of the Airport.
